# enas_pytorch

This repo contains a PyTorch implementation of ENAS [(Efficient Neural Architecture Search via Parameter Sharing)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.03268).
The purpose of creating yet another PyTorch ENAS implementation is for me to personally learn the actual implementation. Besides that, I will try my best to write code that is easy to comperhend.

This repo itself refers to the nice implementation here: https://github.com/invisibleForce/ENAS-Pytorch
